            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This training program is designed to provide singers with the skills and processes necessary to perform opera.
                We will take you through the ins and outs of this art form through specific repeatable exercises.
                There are five aspects of this craft that we will explore.
                These include: singing, acting, speaking the language authentically, learning the music for a specific role accurately, and analyzing/interpreting the text (story-telling).</p>
            <p>Singers need a safe, positive, collaborative, and fun environment that is performance based to grow.
                This program seeks to align the traditional private vocal studio studies with group oriented performance opportunities that focus on bread and butter literature.
                In this winter program, we will explore Engel Humperdinck's intentions in his opera, <i>Hansel unt Gretel</i>, in order to deepen these abilities.</p>
            <p>The acting strategies are based heavily in the work of Anton Chekhov and have been modified to accommodate the needs of opera singers.
                Participants will learn how to create a character and incorporate suggestions to produce varying interpretations in a given environment.
                It is very important to understand the opera from a literary, musical, and historical perspective.
                Non singing activities may include theater games, make-up application, storyboards, movement/dance, posture/ body alignment, choreography, staging, monologues, and more.</p>
            <p>Opera is about communication.  A good singer is well trained.  A great singer is an artist that is able to communicate a message and connect with an audience on an emotional level.
                Sets, costumes, props, lighting, and all the other "stage glitter" can enhance/deter that message.
                Therefore, the participants will play an active role in their creation in order to determine what is communicated by the performance space.</p>
